<h4>
    After reading several articles about design patterns, I felt it was time to try some of them. I decided to start by applying SOLID principles to Laravel. Here is the repository of my study.
    
SOLID is an acronym that represents a set of five principles that are considered a cornerstone in object-oriented programming and design. These principles help in creating software that is easy to maintain, understand, and extend. Here's what each letter in SOLID stands for:

- **S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: This principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should only have one job or responsibility.

- **O: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: According to this principle, software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new features or functionality without changing the existing code.

- **L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: This principle states that in a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced (or substituted) with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.

- **I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: This principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

- **D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: This principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
